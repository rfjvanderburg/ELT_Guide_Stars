# ELT Guide Star Catalogues

This is the repository of work done in preparation of Guide Star
catalogues that will be used by the future ELT during operations.

Workbook 1 explores options to estimate H-band magnitudes for stars
based on their optical colours and Gaia G-band magnitude. The chosen
approach performs well for different stellar types, as well as
different levels of Galactic extinction.

Workbook 2 uses the Gaia simulated Universe to explore the fraction
of problematic binary stars for ELT operations (as defined by their
angular separation and flux ratio).
